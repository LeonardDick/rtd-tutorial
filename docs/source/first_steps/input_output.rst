Output
============

The program is run in a terminal and works by prompting questions to the user. 
All output structures and data files are either directly saved in the current directory where the program was started, or a new folder is created in the working directory.
If there are files or folders in the working directory, which are identically named as the ouput files, the old files are either moved, renamed or overwritten.
Additionally a ``conan.log`` file is written in the current directory, which contains all the output of the program written to the terminal.
