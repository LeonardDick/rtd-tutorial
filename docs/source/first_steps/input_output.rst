Output
============

The program is run in a terminal and works by asking questions to the user. 
All output structures and data files are either directly saved in the current directory where the program was started, or a new folder is created in the current directory.
If there are files of folder names in the directory, which are the same as the ouput files, the old files are either moved and renamed or overwritten.
Additionally a ``conan.log`` file will be written in the current directory, which contains all the output of the program written to the terminal.
