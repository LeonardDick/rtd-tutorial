Density Profiles
================

Radial Denstity
-------------------
The radial density is obtained by scanning through the entire trajectory and identify the number of atoms (including its van der Waals radius) within a certain distance from the center of the CNT. The atoms are weighted by their mass and divided by the number of frames in the trajectory. 
The radial density is then plotted against the distance from the center of the CNT.

Axial Density Profile
-------------------
Compute a density profile along the CNT axis. The density profile is obtained by scanning through the entire trajectory and identify the number of atoms which belong to a certain increment defined by the user.
This can be performed individually for all liquid species present.
