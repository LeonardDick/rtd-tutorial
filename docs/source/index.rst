CONAn - User Guide
===================================

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

**CONAn** is a tool to generate carbon structures, set up MD simulation boxes and analyze MD trajectories composed of a liquid and carbon structures.
The program has the following features:


* Generate carbon structures like carbon walls, carbon nanotubes (CNT) or pores.
* Set up systems with a bulk liquid input file and carbon structures of choice.
* Identify and characterize carbon structures found in a trajectory.
* Calculate the radial density inside a CNT.
* Calculate the accessible volume of a CNT.
* Calculate the axial density along a simulation box.
* Produce xyz files of a frame/pore/CNT (either filled with liquid or empty) from the trajectory.

Additionally the program has a molecule identifier implemented, which makes it possible to perform all analysis for the individual kind of molecules present in the system.

Check out :doc:`first_steps/Installation` for more information on how to install CONAn.
